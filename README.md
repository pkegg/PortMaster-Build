# PortMaster-build
This repository creates build process for PortMaster that allows for repeatable, standardized builds and reuse of libraries/code across ports.

# tl;dr - build a port - docker
- Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on linux/mac/wsl2.
  - `apt-get install docker.io` works on Ubuntu 20.04+ on linux. On WSL2 - ensure you install also install Docker Desktop
- Check/update docker permisssions/plugins with: `./init-docker`
- Build a port: `./build <port name>`.  See the [ports](../ports/) directory for all ports.
  - Ex (these are implemented as 'real' builds): `2048`, `cdogs`, `hcl`, `portmaster`.  See `./build --help` for all options.
- Find the output zip under `./release/<PKG_NAME>.zip`

# tl;dr - build a port - Christian's VM (arm64 chroot)
- Run `./ports/install-deps` to install dependencies into chroot  
- Build a port. Ex:  `./build cdogs --install-deps --no-docker`
- Find the output zip under `./release/<PKG_NAME>.zip`

# Build Goals
- **Backwards Compatible** - Build must be possible to phase-in builds without disruption (or minimal disruption) to the existing process.
- **Standardized** - Ports should be built in a standard and repeatable way.
- **Easy to Build** - Any user should be able to build a port. Deep knowledge of Docker or building source code should not be required.
  -  **Multi-Platform (linux/mac/win)** - Most OS's should work to to build: Linux, Windows (WSL2) and Mac.  Christian's chroots should work.
  -  **Multi-Architecture (amd64/arm/arm64)** - Users can build on/for different architectures (arm, arm64, amd64, etc) without **requiring** cross-compilation.
    - **Allow Cross Compile (but don't require)** - If a porter *wants* to setup cross-compile so compilation is faster on amd64, that should be possible
- **Automation** - Commits should be built and available to the end user.  'Releases' should be possible from the GitHub UI.  All artifacts should be hosted via GitHub.
- **Deduplication** - Build should support duplication of code from ports (examples: copy `control.txt` into all ports, setup global functions for ports, centralize device detection, deduplicate box86 and other libraries, etc)
- **Testable** - It should be possible to run automated tests (`bats`, etc) during build.
 
# GitHub Actions Builds
Builds run in GitHub Actions automatically on commits to `main` and for `PR`'s.

In order to speed up builds and prepare for a lot of custom builds in the future, it uses multiple builds to parallelize.

See: [build-parallel.yaml](.github/workflows/build-parallel.yaml)

# Build Scripts Overview
The build uses docker buildx to provide the dependencies and the docker+qemu emulation needed to run builds for arm/arm64 platforms.  Builds are smart enough to only rebuild if changed.  Having a build system means port builds are repeatable, easier to add and and can include common files/dependencies across all ports.

With docker, builds can be run on linux (Ubuntu 20.04 tested), mac (x86 and m1) and windows (via wsl2 with ubuntu 20.04).  Default build environment is Ubuntu 20.04 x64 - other platforms are known to work, but are only supported on a 'best effort' basis.

NOTE: Running in `christianhaitian`'s Ubuntu VM with debian arm chroot also works.  As the chroot does not have docker, the chroot must be the appropriate platform (arm64, arm32, etc) and dependencies must be manually installed with: `ports/install-deps`, `ports/<port>/install-deps` or manually by the user.

Most scripts are located in `./ports` but frequently used scripts (`build`, `clean`, etc) are added at the top level for convenience.
- `./build <port>` - The main script to build a specific port. By default, it uses auto-generated Dockerfiles to provide build environment via docker.  
  - Uses: `ports/install-deps` to provide environment.  Specific ports can add their own packages via `ports/<port>/install-deps`.
  - Options:
    - `--no-docker`- can be used to run a build w/o docker (dependencies must exist on host).  Known to work in christianhaitian's chroot and Ubuntu 20.04
      - `--install-deps` - Automatically install dependencies if docker is not installed.  Useful in a chroot. 
    - `--no-build-cache` - Run a rebuild rather depend on the build cache.
    - `--docker-remote` - Helps to simulate build server and will not use local docker images
    - see `--help` for full list.  Most other options are only used by github actions during build and/or `./build-all`

- `build-all` - calls `build` for all ports. Accepts all `./build` parameters and will pass them through.
- `bump-versions` - updates `PKG_VERSION` in package.info files to the latest git version.  Respects `PKG_BRANCH` or will use default branch.
- `clean` - cleans out temporary files copied by build and building.  `./clean --ccache` will remove ccache too (if used by a port).
- `clean-all` - calls `clean` for all ports.
- `init-docker` - Checks docker is installed.  Installs docker buildx and qemu emulation for docker if not already installed.
- `ports/build-base-image` - builds the top level `Dockerfile` (`install-deps`).  Not required unless changing `ports/install-deps`
- `run` - This is what is run on-device to start the port.  
- `files` - Any files in this directory will automatically be copied into the package (`pkg` folder) and included in the zip.

Some directories/files are created as part of the build but ignored by git:
- `source` - where the source of the PKG_URL is put.  Build is smart enough to `fetch` latest git if source already exists.
- `pkg` - The directory which will be included as part of the zip.  It is deleted before each build that is run.


# Port Requirements
Each port has a standard layout in the `ports` directory.  The following shows conventions and requirements for port builds and packaging.  The build format is inspired by the LibreElec `package.mk` format, but is kept lighter weight and instead uses the file name `package.info` to indicate it's not compatible.

All packages implicitly have a dependency on `global` unless `PKG_GLOBAL=false` is set. This allows packages to utilize `global-functions` for reuse across ports.

## Port Directory Layout
The following files can be used to build a port.
- `<port folder>` - must be lower case and valid in a docker tag (lower case)
  - `package.info` (Required) - provides information about the package and it's source.
    - NOTE: this is similar to the EmuELEC package.mk format.  It is called package.info to show its not totally compatible.
    - `PKG_NAME` (Required) - The name of the package.  Can include spaces, etc.  Will be used for name of zip and main script.
    - `PKG_DIRECTORY_OVERRIDE` - By default, there is a directory inside the zip which matches the port folder name.  This allows customizing the directory in the zip.
    - `PKG_ZIP_NAME_OVERRIDE` - By default, the zip is named according to `PKG_NAME`.  This allows overriding the name of the output zip file.
    - `PKG_URL` - The source code url.  Will be cloned into `source`. Smart enough to do a `git pull` if already exists.
    - `PKG_VERSION` (Required - if PKG_URL) - the version of source code - typically git hash or tag.  
      - NOTE: though a branch name (`main`) is technically allowed for now, it is not 'supported' as the package will not be rebuilt unless something changes in the ports directory.  See the build caching section.
    - `PKG_DEPENDS` - A comma separated list of dependent packages which will be built first and included in it's `pkg`.  Dependent packages will be built and their `pkg` contents into this ports `pkg` folder.  Transitive dependendencies (package A depends on B which depends on C are not supported) to keep things simple.
      - NOTE: `PKG_DEPENDS` artifacts cannot be utilized by the `build` step, but only the `package` step.  This enables depedency updates to only require repackaging and not a full rebuild.
    - `PKG_LIBRARY` - Means this package can be used in another `PKG_DEPENDS`.  Used to 'pre-build' all libraries on build server.
    - `GET_HANDLER_SUPPORT` - currently only `git` and `archive` are supported. Can be left off and defaults to `git` if PKG_URL is set.
    - `PKG_GLOBAL` - If set to `false`, global depedencies will not be copied in.
    - `LEGACY_PORTMASTER` - Setting this enabled building from *previous* portmaster zips located in the root of the repository.  This makes it easy for builds to stay up to date with zips that have not been updated to the new build proces.  Only `PKG_NAME` is required if `LEGACY_PORTMASTER` is set.
    - `LEGACY_URL_OVERRIDE` - Setting this along with `LEGACY_PORTMASTER=true` allows pointing to a location to download zips too big to be checked into github (UQM, SuperTux, etc).  Ex: `LEGACY_URL_OVERRIDE="http://139.196.213.206/arkos/ports/UQM.zip`
    - `BUILD_PLATFORM`- Allows setting the platform used via Docker to build.  Defaults to: `linux/arm64/v8`.  
      - Valid choices are: `linux/arm64/v8`, `linux/arm/v7` (32 bit arm), `linux/amd64` (64 bit x86 - for cross compile) and `any` (builds w/o binaries)
    - `TEST_PLATFORM`- Allows setting the platform used via Docker to run tests.  Defaults to `BUILD_PLATFORM`.
    - `PKG_NO_MAIN_SCRIPT` - By default, ports zip has a main script (`<PKG_NAME>.sh`) at the root of the zip.  If this is set to true, exclude it (ex: `portmaster`)

  - `build` - script to run build.
    - Will be run from `source` directory if one was created or the port directory if one does not exist.
    - The script can output build artifacts to the `pkg` directory.  For longer builds or complex packaging logic, it is suggested to use a `package` script.  This allows faster rebuilds on packaging changes even in the cloud.
    - NOTE: Will be run with bash.
  - `package` - script to package build.
    - Will be run from the port directory and should populate the `pkg` directory.
    - Not strictly required if copying files into `pkg` is done in the `build` script.  But convenient if `build` takes a long time.
  - `test` - will run tests inside a docker image
  - `install-deps` - provides any addition dependencies for build beyond main Dockerfile.

# Release Hosting
The legacy process of hosting .zip files at the root of the git repository is easy/simple, but has issues:
 - Every zip increases git repo size, making git clones take longer and longer over time.
 - No easy way to see what's different in each port.
 - Max file size of 100MB, meaning some ports like UQM and SuperTux have to be hosted somewhere else, leading to more complexity.

The updated `./build` process will create zips under `./release` - these zips *can* be used to update the legacy zips in the git repo.  However, the intent is to create a different process which `portmaster` can then use for downloads.

In short - the new release hosting process will simply use github releases to host all zips. The 'latest' release will be used by portmaster so that the download code is almost identical (note: the releases will be versioned, but github provides a 'latest' url that will get the most recent).  To avoid rebuilding all ports for every release, remote build caching (`./build --remote-build-cache`) makes it so that zips that have not changed and just be re-downloaded from a previous release and re-published.

Advantages:
- No 100MB file size limit
- Very similar download code for PortMaster
- Zips can be removed from root of repository (at least once they are not used by any `LEGACY_PORTMASTER=true` builds)

Disadvantages:
- Requires automation as each release has all ports - but we can use github actions to automate this for free.
- We have to be careful to not break compatibility.


## Hosting Structure
There is a github action which can be triggered to create a release.  This action will build all ports (using caching of prior releases to speed build) and publish a release with the format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM` ex: `2021-11-18_2337`.  

This release will have .zips for all ports as well as `.git.info` files which contains the caching metadata used to determine if a build has changed.

Though there are some minor differences with GitHub Releases (spaces are turned into '.'), portmaster can be updated to point to the following url and it more or less works: `https://github.com/<org>/PortMaster/releases/latest/download/`

# Build Caching Overview
**tl;dr;** Caching is important, so we made a caching layer to speed up builds.  Disable it on build with `./build --no-build-cache`.

---

Caching builds is quite important due to a variety of factors:
  - Takes a long time to build certain ports (CPU intensive, etc)
  - The sheer *number* of ports in PortMaster.
    - If we build them all squentially, it could take many hours (or days) to build even if they build pretty fast.  There won't ever be 'less' ports.
  - The low CPU specs of Github Actions 'free' builders
    - Ideally - we use GitHub actions to build for free - but the free builders are not particularly powerful

To address this, we've create a build caching system that can be used to determine if a given port needs to be rebuilt (or it's dependencies rebuilt and it repackaged).  Initially docker was considered, but the sheer scale of number of docker images being created caused issues in github's container registry and errored very unreliably.

**Build Caching 101: Something must change in a port folder for it to be rebuilt**
The main idea is that: in order for a port to be rebuilt, something that ports folder *must* change.  This makes it easy to take a `hash` of the files in the directory to determine if anything has changed.

This is a big reason why `PKG_VERSION` cannot/should not be set to `main` an instead is set to the git hash.

At it's simplest, the build caching system just uses git to look at the last change hash on a port folder (and dependent folders) and records that in a .git.info file.  Ex:
```
portmaster=52b0424
global=3f9a625
oga_controls_portmaster=4d151fc
dialog=52b0424
```

Then, it is easy to determine if a port needs to be rebuilt.  In the above example, if the `portmaster` lines change - `portmaster` needs to be rebuild.  If the dependencies change, those dependencies need to be rebuilt and portmaster needs to be repackaged.

This works great for a build server, but what about local changes?  In the case of local changes, any files known to git are recorded and then hashed.  This makes it so even local changes use this smart caching behavior. 

Ex:
```
portmaster=52b0424
portmaster_dirty=control.txt,package.info,
portmaster_dirty_hash=9db57015f8a83455700dc20621ac5becb76b03f3
global=3f9a625
oga_controls_portmaster=4d151fc
dialog=52b0424
```

If there are issues - or something outside of a port folder needs to retrigger a build, `--no-build-cache` can be used.


## Remote Build Caching
By default, `./build` does not look at github releases for build cache due to the high number of API request to do so and only looks at local files in `./releases`.  Remote build caching can be enabled by running `./build --remote-build-cache` and is used when running with GitHub Actions.  In order to use, `export GITHUB_TOKEN=<token>` must be run in your terminal to provide a valid token and increase GitHub's API rate limit from 60 request an hour.  
See: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token

Remote build caching will use GitHub APIs to evaluate the previous releases `.git.info` files and see if it matches your local files.  If it's a match, the port's `.zip` will be downloaded and used instead of fully rebuilding.  `./build` is smart enough to detect cases where dependencies have changed so only repackaging is needed.  This allows quick rebuilds of things like `global` or `oga_controls` without rebuilding a ton of packages

# Running Ports on Device

## Background
One of the goals of PortMaster is to ensure that everything is included in the zip that is needed for a given port (libs, script to run, etc).  One problem with this technically is that there's a lot of duplication across zip files (device detection, common libraries).  This means that supporting new devices or fixing bugs in many zips is **hard**.

## Deduplication

One approach that has simplified things greatly is using `control.txt`.  This is a huge improvement, but does have a drawback that the port now depends on the current version of portmaster.

Using a build system, we can now easily have files which are included in all ports.  This means we can deduplicate a lot of the code and even include control.txt, etc.

There may be additional simplification of control.txt as well.

## Goals
- Ports should ideally have no *device specific* code in their scripts.  This means that new, similar devices can be added without additional code in each port.
  - In places where device specific code would be used, some intermediate variable should be used instead.  For example: resolution or number of analog sticks.  This way, unless a device has something novel (a new resolution, etc) which the port needs to account for, it can be updated seamlessly. 
- Ports should have as little OS specific code in their scripts as possible.  Typically, only for things like additional libraries needed.

## global-functions

`control.txt` is a great step forward for reuse, but there are still cases where: 1. `control.txt` can't ecapsulate everything the port script needs to do. 2. `control.txt` needs better ways to be tested and kept simple as more and more things are added to it.

In these cases, `global-functions` can help.  Basically,`global-functions` can be sourced without any change and then has individual methods for things like `get_os`, `get_device`, etc.  These functions contain either *no* global variables or variables that start with `__` so they are unlikely to be inadvertantly used by other scripts.  Tests can be written in [bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) to ensure tricky things like device/OS detection are correct once verified.

See documentation in [portmaster](./ports/portmaster-refactor/README.md) and [global](./ports/global/README.md)
